Roadmap:

1. Immediate Priorities:
   - **Soong Management**: Create a real-time searching feature for song selection based on search filters, playlists or user input.
   - **Search Functionality**: Add a filter to allow users to search songs by title in the app. This will help them find the exact song they are looking for quickly and easily.
   - **Modern UI**: Use the Semantic UI framework for better accessibility, especially with regards to keyboard shortcuts.

2. Short-term Goals:

   - **Audio Playback**: Implement actual music playing functionality using native React-native audio API to support streaming and playing of songs from the library.
   - **PWA Support**: Integrate Progressive Web App (PWA) features like offline support, which will allow users to listen to music without internet connection, making our app more convenient and user-friendly.

3. Medium-term Visions:
   - **DaRk Mode**: Implement dark mode in the app for better accessibility and overall user experience.
   - **Analytics**: Implement user tracking to understand how users interact with our app and what they like or dislike about it. This will help us improve our products and services based on user feedback, resulting in a more effective mobile music player application.

4. Long-term Strategy:
   - **Concept**: Create a vision for the future of our music player app, aiming to create a comprehensive experience that offers users an enjoyable, convenient, and engaging way to listen to music. This will include features like integrating social media platforms, creating personalized playlists based on user preferences, and offering exclusive artist interviews.
