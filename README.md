5. Add playback controls like pause, next, previous, and skip forward/backward.
6. Create an album art feature with hover effects for better visual appeal.
7. Incorporate Spotify Connect integration, enabling users to connect their devices and stream songs directly from the app.
8. Integration of Apple Music Connect feature for automatic uploading of playlists to Apple Music.
9. Add sharing options like Facebook and Twitter.
10. Implement social features like inviting friends to join playlists and creating new ones.

Search Functionality:

8. Add keyboard shortcuts for easy navigation of the app.

Progressive Web App (PWA) Support:

1. Develop an application shell to provide a seamless user experience with offline support.
2. Incorporate PWA features like offline caching and background sync to improve app performance.
3. Use Progressive Web App (PWA) certification from Google to ensure app speed and stability.
4. Test the app on multiple devices and platforms, including Android and iOS, to achieve seamless operation across all platforms.
5. Integrate Google Analytics to track user behavior and generate insights for optimization.
6. Incorporate push notifications to notify users of new songs or updates to their playlists.
