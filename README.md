## AI-Improved Roadmap (Iteration 3)
*Generated on: 2025-06-29 14:34:44*

Section 1: Immediate Priorities
- Create the app with React and Redux, including user authentication and playlists management
- Implement audio playing functionality using modern React libraries (React 18 Modern React with hooks and concurrent features) and the Semantic UI CSS framework for beautiful UI components.
- Integrate Reactive Redux to manage state and provide smooth performance with a progressive Web App (PWA) feature.
- Implement DaRk Mode to offer darker visual experience and user interface customization options.
- Test the app on various devices, including desktop and mobile browsers, and integrate Analytics to track user interactions for better insights and optimization.

Section 2: Short-term Goals (1-3 months)
- Implement User Interface (UI) mockups with designers for final visual appeal and usability testing before development.
- Create initial playlists using Semantic UI, using Music Genre, Artist, Album, and Song filters to filter songs from a curated list.
- Add search functionality to allow users to find songs based on keywords or specific metadata (e.g., title, genre, album).
- Implement Audio Playback (PLAY) function with proper playlist management for smooth streaming experience.
- Integrate Progressive Web App (PWA) feature for better user experience and performance on devices with slower internet connection.

Section 3: Medium-term Visions (3-6 months)
- Add Music Genre, Artist, Album, and Song filters to further enhance user experience by allowing users to filter songs based on their preferences.
- Integrate Social Media Sharing (SHARE) feature with popular social media platforms for easy sharing of favorite songs with friends.
- Implement Reactive Redux with ARIA labels to provide accessibility support, such as alt text and spoken captions for visually impaired users.
- Incorporate error handling mechanisms to improve user experience by providing graceful error recovery.

Section 4: Long-term Strategy (6-12 months)
- Develop a DARE (Designed for Artists, Readers, Ecophiles) User Group with a Discord server for users and artists to connect with each other and share their music preferences.
- Offer Music Video Playback feature using YouTube API to provide more visual content for musicians.
- Implement Spotify Connect API integration for seamless streaming experience among devices with different operating systems.
- Integrate Amazon Music Cloud functionality to stream songs from Amazon Prime or Amazon Music HD libraries, while maintaining a balance between music quality and streaming time for users.
