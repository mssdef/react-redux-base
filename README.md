## AI-Improved Roadmap (Iteration 3)
*Generated on: 2025-06-28 16:47:45*

I would like to create a roadmap for the following steps:

1. Immediate priorities (2-4 weeks):
   - Conduct user research and gather insights to improve the app's usability, such as creating a seamless user experience and reducing friction points for users.
   - Develop wireframes and prototypes of the app's layout and functionality to test and refine ideas before implementing them in production.
   - Build and deploy the app's initial beta version to ensure it runs smoothly and is bug-free.
2. Short-term goals (1-3 months):
   - Implement essential features such as song playback, music management, and search functionality.
   - Develop error handling and user authentication solutions using modern technologies like React Redux and Semantic UI.
   - Create a visual design that showcases the app's unique identity and enhances user experience through color schemes, typography, and UX patterns.
3. Medium-term vision (3-6 months):
   - Implement dark mode functionality to enhance users' privacy and overall experience.
   - Launch a PWA (Progressive Web App) to increase app stability and user retention.
   - Build out deeper integration with music streaming platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, and Tidal.
4. Long-term strategy (6-12 months):
   - Continuously improve the app's functionality by adding new features such as playlists management, multi-device support, and real-time updates from online platforms.
   - Launch a subscription service to generate revenue while maintaining user privacy through data protection measures.
   - Collaborate with music artists and labels to add their works to the app's library for users to discover new music.
   - Stay updated on emerging technologies in the music industry, such as AI-powered personalized playlists and immersive sound environments, to stay ahead of the curve and provide the best possible user experience.
