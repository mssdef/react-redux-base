To improve performance, the team has started minifying CSS and JavaScript files to reduce page load times. They have also optimized image sizes and used responsive design patterns for better user experience on different screen sizes. In terms of component structure and organization, the app has adopted the "isomorphic" approach by importing all necessary components and data using the import() statement. This allows them to load and render components in both the client-side and server-side environments seamlessly.

To align with the project's purpose, the team has added features that enhance functionality and improve user experience. These include adding a feature that plays back music by default on a device's home screen, allowing users to choose between playlists and playback options based on their preferences, and offering a feature for automatic detection of connected devices (e.g., Bluetooth or WiFi) and playing back audio from them.

The team has also ensured that improvements align with the project's purpose by applying modern React/Redux best practices, performing automated testing using Jest and Selenium, documenting and commenting their code, and optimizing performance. By following these steps, they have been able to significantly improve the quality of their codebase and provide better user experience on all devices.
