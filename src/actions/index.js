2. Implement features that would enhance functionality: Implement feature A that solves problem X and feature B that solves problem Y. Use best practices for designing and implementing these features, such as using state management techniques like redux or react-redux to maintain state consistency, utilizing responsive design principles to optimize layouts, and using a proper architecture pattern (e.g., MVP) for organizing components.

3. Apply modern React/Redux best practices: Use the latest version of react and its associated libraries like redux, use proper naming conventions, and use functional components where possible instead of classes. Utilize styling libraries like css-in-js or styled-components to style components using css in a modular way.

4. Optimize performance where possible: Use modern tricks for optimizing performance such as lazy loading or hot reloading, implement server-side rendering to enhance the user experience, and use analytics tools to gather insights on user behavior and optimize content accordingly.

5. Add proper error handling: Use the proper error handling system such as using try-catch blocks to catch common errors like missing dependencies or incorrect data. Use linting tools to ensure that code follows coding conventions and to detect potential security vulnerabilities.

6. Ensure improvements align with project's purpose: Implement feature A that solves problem X and feature B that solves problem Y. Use the project's guidelines for implementation, such as following best practices for naming conventions and using proper data access patterns, to ensure that code aligns with the project's goals.

7. Improvement of component structure and organization: Use proper architectural patterns like MVP or MVC (model-view-controller) to organize components in a modular way that allows for easy modification and customization. Utilize testing frameworks such as jest, enzyme, or jest-dom to ensure that code is working correctly under different scenarios.

Provide the complete improved code structure and organization for clarity and readability purposes. Do not include irrelevant text or comments in the response.
