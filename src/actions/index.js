After reviewing the original codebase and discussing proposed changes to improve the code quality, readability, performance, and project alignment, we propose the following code changes:

1. Fix any bugs or runtime errors: Use the Error object for handling errors in component state management, use a proper error handling system in the app's root file, etc.

2. Impovse code quality and readability: Use proper commenting techniques, keep the code organized using functional components and props, separate business logic from UI/UX, avoid duplicating data or functionality between different components, and use best practices for error handling and testing.

3. Add missing features that would enhance functionality: Implement features such as offline access, caching, push notifications, authentication, user profiles, etc.

4. Apply modern React/Redux best practices: Use Redux's tools to manage state and use context to provide a simple and clean API for components to consume, use the latest CSS-in-JS libraries like Styled Components for styling and component architecture patterns such as functional components or stateless functional components.

5. Optimize performance where possible: Use advanced optimization techniques such as lazy loading, hot reloading, and code splitting in the app's root file, use best practices for reducing HTTP requests, and implement server-side rendering to enhance performance.

6. Add proper error handling: Use the proper error handling system in the app's root file, use a proper error handling middleware or API gateway to handle API errors and avoid unnecessary exceptions, etc.

7. Improvement of component structure and organization: Use functional components for reducing code complexity and maintainability, separate logic from UI/UX design using responsive design principles, and keep the app's components organized in logical groups such as user profile or music library.

8. Ensure improvements align with the project's purpose: Optimize the app's architecture to enhance performance and scalability by implementing server-side rendering and caching techniques for static assets, use a proper CI/CD pipeline to automate code deployments and test runs, etc.
