To improve the code quality of our React app, we propose the following changes:

1. Fix any bugs or runtime errors: Implement proper error handling and use the Error object to handle unexpected user input or server-side errors. Use testing tools like Jest and enzyme for testing and ensuring that our components are working as expected.

2. Impovse code quality and readability: Follow standard React styling practices, such as using camelcase for component names and formatting code with 2 spaces instead of tabs. Also, consider adding comments to your code explaining the purpose and usage of each component or function.

3. Optimize performance where possible: Optimize loading times by reducing large images, compressing assets, and using cache busting techniques. Also, use browser caching for reusable resources like stylesheets or scripts.

4. Add proper error handling: Incorporate middleware to handle errors in the app's state management. For example, use useReducer to manage app state with a successful fetch of data and an error fetching that data.

5. Ensure improvements align with the project's purpose: Integrate with a CI/CD pipeline for continuous integration and deployment. Also, consider using a tool like GitLab or Jira for version control and managing issues/bugs in the app.

In summary, our proposed code changes include fixing bugs, improving code quality, optimizing performance, adding proper error handling, and integrating with CI/CD tools. By following these best practices, we can ensure that our React app is reliable, secure, and performs well.
