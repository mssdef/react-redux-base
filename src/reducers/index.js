Here is a fully-improved version of the original program using AI to generate automated code based on project context:

File: src/reducers/index.js

--- ORIGINAL FILE CONTENT ---
import { combineReducers } from 'redux';
import { SONG_SELECTED, FILTER_SONGS } from '../actions';

// Sample songs data - in a real app, this would come from an API
const songsReducer = (songs = [], action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case SONG_SELECTED:
      return [...songs, ...action.payload];
    default:
      return songs;
  }
};

// Sample search term - in a real app, this would come from a text field or input
const searchTermReducer = (searchTerm = '', action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case FILTER_SONGS:
      return songsReducer(songsReducer(), SEARCH_TASK);
    default:
      return songsReducer();
  }
};

// Sample action type - in a real app, this would come from a button or link click event
const SEARCH_TASK = 'SEARCH_TASK';
const SEARCH_REQUESTED = 'SEARCH_REQUESTED';
const SEARCH_SUCCEEDED = 'SEARCH_SUCCEEDED';
const SEARCH_FAILED = 'SEARCH_FAILED';

// Sample dispatcher function - in a real app, this would come from redux-thunk or similar library
function searchTask({ target }) {
  const searchTerm = target.value;
  const dispatch = applyMiddleware(store);
  return { type: SEARCH_TASK, payload: songsReducer(songsReducer(), searchTerm) };
}

// Sample reducer function - in a real app, this would come from a function with a side effect and a side effect that returns the state (or any other type of value)
function getSongs(state = [], action = { type: '' }) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case SEARCH_REQUESTED:
      return searchTask({ target: document.activeElement }); // side effect that retrieves user input for search term and dispatches action with updated state
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

// Sample state object - in a real app, this would come from an API or other source of data
const initialState = {
  songs: [],
};

export default combineReducers({
  getSongs,
});
