- Open your Git client (e.g., GitKraken, TortoiseGit)
   - Click on "Branches" tab
   - Click on "New Branch" button
   - Give the branch a descriptive name and choose to create a new branch based on the latest develop branch (default is true)
   - Once you've created the branch, it will appear in the Git repository with a green checkmark.

2. Open your Git client (e.g., GitKraken, TortoiseGit) and check the status of the codebase:
   - Navigate to the root directory of the project
   - Run the following command in the Git client:
     - Type "git status" or hit Enter to get a summary of all changes made on the local branch since last commit
     - You can also use other commands like "git add" or "git commit" to stage and commit changes to the branch, respectively.

3. Use Git's command-line interface to create an issue for each enhancement request:
   - Navigate to the root directory of the project
   - Open a terminal window and enter the following commands in sequence:
     - Type "git issue new" or hit Enter to open the command prompt with an empty issue file ("ISSUE_NUMBER")
     - Enter a descriptive name for the enhancement (e.g., Feature Enhancement, Bug Fix)
     - Press Enter to create the issue in the Git repository
   - You can also use other commands like "git issue new" or "git issue add" to add changes to an existing issue or create a new one.

4. Use GitHub's pull request feature to collaborate with others:
   - Navigate to the root directory of the project
   - Open a terminal window and enter the following commands in sequence:
     - Type "git fetch" or hit Enter to update the branch that contains the latest changes from the upstream repository (e.g., origin/develop)
     - Type "git pull" or hit Enter to pull down the latest changes from the remote repository (e.g., upstream/develop)
     - Type "git status" or hit Enter to get a summary of all changes made on the branch since last commit
     - You can also use other commands like "git fetch" or "git merge" to merge changes from another branch into the active branch.
   - After making your changes, run the following command in the Git client:
     - Type "git push origin HEAD" or hit Enter to add and push your changes to the project on GitHub.

5. Use a continuous integration (CI) tool like CircleCI or Jenkins to automatically run tests, linting, and other checks:
   - Navigate to the root directory of the project
   - Open a terminal window and enter the following commands in sequence:
     - Type "npm install" or hit Enter to install any necessary dependencies
     - Type "npm test" or hit Enter to run the tests
     - Type "npm lint" or hit Enter to run the linter (e.g., ESLint)
   - You can also use other commands like "npm run build" or "npm run style:check" to execute additional checks or build the project if needed.

Conclusion: By following these steps, you can automate the contribution process for improving the software's functionality by using Git, GitHub, and CI tools. This approach allows for seamless collaboration between developers and reduces the time it takes to iterate and make incremental changes to the codebase.
