- üåê **Internationalization**: Implement Internationalization (I18n) using React-Intl library.
- ‚≠êÔ∏è **Modern Design**: Optimize the UI design by reusing icons and components, using the new CSS variables syntax, and using responsive design techniques.

### Important Notes for Enhancements:

1. When adding a new feature or enhancement, ensure it aligns with the project's purpose and adds value to the user experience.
2. Test thoroughly and properly document your changes in the README.md file.
3. Use meaningful variable names for both imports and components to make your code easier to read and understand.
4. Always use proper naming conventions for component classes, like making them camelCase or keeping a hyphen or underscore between words.
5. Use modern best practices to handle server-side rendering, including using Next.js or Gatsby for the frontend stack, and using Apollo Client for GraphQL queries.
6. Implement error handling for any unhandled errors in the frontend codebase.
7. Maintain a clear commit history with descriptive commits, one feature at a time.
8. Continuously improve the project's performance and ensure it runs smoothly on modern devices and browsers.
9. Use proper testing techniques for any components that handle server-side rendering or GraphQL queries to make sure they run efficiently.
10. Implement proper error handling for any backend errors in the backend codebase, especially those that might affect the user's experience.

### Enhancements Strategies:

1. If adding a new feature, create an issue or enhancement to track progress and communicate with other developers.
2. Use existing code as a base for inspiration and design ideas.
3. Implement the feature using the best practices of your chosen frontend stack.
4. Test thoroughly and document your enhancements with detailed descriptions and screenshots.
5. Optimize your changes by minimizing server-side rendering, using GraphQL queries or Redux to manage data flow, and using responsive design techniques.
