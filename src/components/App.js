To improve upon the existing code, we suggest the following improvements:

1. Fix any bugs or runtime errors:
- Make sure all functionalities work correctly and do not exhibit unexpected behavior. This will ensure a smooth user experience.
- Implement error handling to prevent unexpected crashes or data loss in case of an unexpected error.

2. Improve code quality and readability:
- Use proper variable names, make the code easier to understand by adding comments where necessary.
- Fold long lines into single lines where possible. This will make the code more readable.
- Use modern JavaScript syntax, which includes features like functional programming, ES6, and ES2015+ (if applicable).

3. Add missing features:
- Ensure that all necessary functionalities are included in the app. This includes features such as playback controls, search functionality, and song information.

4. Apply modern React/Redux best practices:
- Use Redux for state management and composable components. This will ensure a stable and modular architecture of the app.
- Follow best practices like using functional components instead of class components, and using proper testing frameworks to catch bugs early in development.

5. Optimize performance where possible:
- Use caching techniques to minimize server requests, reduce load on the database, and improve page load times.
- Use efficient data structures such as arrays or hash tables for storage and retrieval of song information, and optimize loading times by preloading these data structures into memory.

By implementing these improvements, we hope to create a modern and efficient version of the existing app that aligns with the project's purpose and enhances functionality.
