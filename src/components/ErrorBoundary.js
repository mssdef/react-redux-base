3. Use the useReducer() function to manage state in a clean and organized way. This will help you to reduce code duplication and make the app more resilient against server errors.
4. Implement proper error messages for the user by using React's context API to provide unique error messages based on the HTTP status code.
5. Test the ErrorBoundary component thoroughly by simulating different types of server errors (e.g., 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error) and ensuring that the app handles them gracefully.
6. Optimize the performance of the app by minimizing server requests. This can be achieved by using Axios or other libraries to make HTTP requests, instead of directly connecting to a REST API.
7. Use modern React/Redux best practices like using functional components, proper error handling, and test-driven development for app improvements.

By following these steps, you will improve the ErrorBoundary component's performance and provide better error handling for user interactions with your app.
