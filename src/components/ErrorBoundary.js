To improve the implementation of the proposed solution according to the given instructions, follow these steps:

1. Address any runtime errors and bugs that may occur during testing. This can be done by using libraries like React's `useState` hook, which helps to minimize server requests and avoid unnecessary state updates.

2. Implement modern React/Redux best practices, such as using functional components instead of classes, avoiding unnecessary state updates, and minimizing server requests. This can be done by implementing the new features or functions in a component that separates the logic from the UI.

3. Optimize performance where possible. This can be done by removing unnecessary server requests, caching data, and utilizing web frameworks like Axios to make API calls more efficient.

4. Apply modern React/Redux best practices, such as using functional components instead of classes, avoiding unnecessary state updates, and minimizing server requests.

5. Implement proper error handling by checking for invalid inputs and displaying appropriate error messages. This can be done by using libraries like Axios to handle API errors gracefully.

6. Improvement of component structure and organization by separating components into logical modules or files, making them more readable and easy to understand.

7. Ensure that the app aligns with the project's purpose by adding new features that enhance functionality and provide better user experiences. This can be done by implementing new functionalities or features in a separate module or file as needed.
