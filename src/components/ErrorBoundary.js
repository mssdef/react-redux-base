To improve the implementation of the proposed solution, follow these steps:

1. Address any runtime errors and bugs that may occur during testing. This can be done by adding error handling to ensure that the app continues to function even if some critical data is missing or an unexpected error occurs.

2. Improve the readability and maintainability of the code. This means simplifying functions, reducing code duplication, and using good naming conventions. It also includes refactoring code to remove unused variables, functions, or methods, and improving variable names to make them more descriptive.

3. Optimize performance where possible. This can be done by using libraries like React's `useState` hook, which can reduce the number of times a state is checked and updated. It can also improve the loading speed of the app by caching data or minimizing server requests.

4. Improve the structure of the component hierarchy. This means grouping related components together into a logical tree or module, and separating out functions as needed. It can also help to keep code organized and easy to read.

5. Implement modern React/Redux best practices, which includes using functional components instead of classes, avoiding unnecessary state updates, and minimizing server requests.

6. Ensure that the app aligns with the project's purpose by including features that enhance functionality or provide better user experiences. This could include adding new features or functions to improve the app's usability or adding additional functionalities related to the project's goals or objectives.
