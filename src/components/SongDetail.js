4. Optimize performance where possible by minimizing code repetition, reducing network requests, and improving caching techniques where applicable. Use profiling tools like Chrome DevTools or Lighthouse to identify inefficiencies and improve overall load times.

5. Ensure component structure and organization are well-documented and follow best practices for design patterns, such as using a single, centralized component for common functionality or organizing components into a hierarchy based on their roles in the app's larger structure.

6. Ensure that new features and bug fixes align with the project's scope, priorities, and deliverables. Provide clear instructions for contributors on how to work with the codebase and ensure that all tasks are assigned appropriately.

7. Finally, ensure that the final build or release is thoroughly tested by a team of experts in various areas such as user experience, accessibility, security, and scalability. Testing should cover different use cases and scenarios to ensure a high level of user satisfaction and a robust, stable product.
