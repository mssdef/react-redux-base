2. Use modern React/Redux best practices such as using hooks instead of functions, using state management methods like redux or connect, and following consistency in naming conventions. For example, instead of calling `props` a single time (`props.size`), it would be better to call them multiple times to match the number of arguments sent.

3. Optimize performance where possible. This includes removing unnecessary calculations, using efficient data structures such as arrays or maps, and avoiding expensive operations when they are not needed (such as sorting, filtering, or rendering large numbers of elements).

4. Implement proper error handling for any issues that may occur during the loading process. For example, if there's an issue retrieving data from a server, it would be better to handle this gracefully and display a helpful message instead of a failed request.

5. Ensure code is properly organized and easy to read. Use meaningful variable names, separate concerns with clear boundaries (such as one component for user input, another for logic), and use consistent formatting conventions throughout the file. This makes it easier to follow the code's logic and understand how each piece of functionality relates to the others.

By following these suggestions, you can make the code in src/compomencs/LoadingSpinner.js more efficient, easy to read, and improve overall code quality.
