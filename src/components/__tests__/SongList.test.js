To improve on the original code based on the project context, here are some additional improvements:

1. Improve performance: The initial version of the code had a high loading time due to heavy dependency injection and state management. To optimize performance, reduce the number of dependencies and use more optimized components for UI rendering and data fetching.

2. Add proper error handling: Some errors in the API or database could cause the entire application to crash. Implement error handling using catch blocks or Promise.catch() methods. Use appropriate error messages and prompt the user to try again.

3. Optimize component structure: The initial version of the code had too many components with similar functionality, which made it hard to maintain and understand. To simplify the component hierarchy, organize them into smaller components that focus on a specific feature or task. Use class-based components instead of function-based ones if possible.

4. Add missing features: The initial version of the code did not have some crucial functionalities such as searching for songs or filtering results. To add these features, update the code to include missing functionality or create new modules that provide these capabilities.

5. Apply modern React/Redux best practices: Redux is a popular state management library used in this project. However, using it can result in slow page load times due to heavy data processing and rendering. To optimize performance, use the latest React/Redux features such as immutable data stores, lazy loading of components, and lazy-loading of dependencies.

6. Improve documentation: The initial version of the code had poor documentation, making it difficult for others to understand its purpose or functionality. Implement proper documentation using READMEs or Markdown files with comments explaining each component and action taken by the user.
