- remove unnecessary calls to setState() for components that don't require any state change, such as when rendering a single item in a list
- ensure the application uses efficient algorithms and operations when working with large datasets

improvement 5: add missing features that would enhance functionality
- implement sorting by artist name or album title, or create a feature where users can sort results based on their preferences
- add filtering capabilities for songs based on genre, release year, popularity, or any other criteria that would be useful to the user

by improving and optimizing these areas of the codebase, you'll make your project more efficient and enjoyable to use.
