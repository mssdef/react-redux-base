Improvement: Fix any bugs or runtime errors

In addition to improving the project's overall quality and readability, this improvement would ensure that the app is free from unexpected errors, which could potentially lead to users experiencing frustration and abandoning the application. This would be particularly important for a music player app aimed at experienced listeners who are likely to encounter technical issues when using the platform.

Improvement: Add missing features that would enhance functionality (consider the project context from README)

Adding new functionalities or features would require an increased investment in time and resources, as it would entail developing new components or code. However, this would be beneficial for the project as it would provide users with a more comprehensive and engaging listening experience.

Approach: Implement missing features using modern React/Redux best practices

To accomplish this improvement, it would be important to implement modern React/Redux best practices that are essential in keeping up with the rapidly evolving technology landscape. This approach would entail utilizing functional programming techniques such as hooks and reusability, among others. By doing so, users would have a more intuitive and seamless user experience when navigating through the application.

Proposed changes:
1. Add missing functionality by implementing a search bar or filter component to allow users to easily access specific genres or artists they are interested in.
2. Incorporate pagination into the playback list to improve user experience, providing users with an alternative mode of navigation while enjoying music.
3. Implement a media library that allows users to import and manage their music library, enabling them to easily access songs that they already own or those they have purchased from various online platforms.
4. Integrate recommendations for similar artists to provide users with a personalized listening experience based on their past listening habits.
5. Implement additional functionalities like shuffle or repeat modes, providing users with more options to customize the way music is enjoyed.
6. Use modern CSS techniques such as flexbox and animations to enhance the user interface, making it more visually appealing and user-friendly.
7. Continuously improve and maintain the app by ensuring that it stays up-to-date with the latest releases from music streaming services or platforms, providing users with the most current content at all times.
