```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>

        <title>Music Player</title>
        <!-- Semantic UI CSS -->
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/semantic-ui@2.4.2/dist/semantic.min.css" />
    </head>
    <body>
      <noscript>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.</noscript>
      <div id="root"></div>
      <!--
        This HTML file is a template.
        If you open it directly in the browser, you will see an empty page.

        To add features or updates as soon as possible:
        - Download and apply the app's latest update (click on the "Update" button)
        - or run the following command in your terminal/command prompt:
            yarn add music-player
            yarn start
      -->
    </body>
