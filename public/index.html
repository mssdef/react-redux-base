Improvement: Implement a media player that supports multiple audio formats, such as MP3, WAV, and FLAC, to allow users to choose the best one for their listening preferences. This feature would help users to easily switch between different music genres or moods without having to manually change playback settings. It would also be useful for users who are used to using certain audio files from specific platforms or artists.

Improvement: Use React Native's AudioPlayer component, which is a simple and efficient way to integrate media players into your app. This component supports a variety of formats, including MP3 and FLAC. You can easily add this component to the app using the "import" statement and then use it in your components or functionalities.

Propriedades:
- A prop named "audioPlayer" is used to pass the AudioPlayer instance to the component that needs to play media.

Como se utilizar:
- Comando para iniciar a carga de um arquivo: `AudioPlayer.play(newUri)`
- Comando para parar e pausar o audio: `audioPlayer.pause()` e `audioPlayer.play()`

A media player will be integrated into the user interface, making it more visually appealing and easier to navigate. This feature would increase the app's user experience and provide users with better access to their favorite music tracks.
