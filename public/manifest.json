To improve the functionality of the app further, add a feature that enables users to customize the app's appearance and layout to suit their preferences. For instance, users can choose from different color schemes, font sizes, and styles for the homepage, search bar, and notification settings. This would provide users with greater control over how they interact with the app and enhance their overall user experience.

In addition, allow users to set their preferred language or region, including options such as English, Chinese, Japanese, and German. This would provide a more personalized and inclusive experience for users who may speak different languages. Furthermore, integrate machine learning algorithms to recommend custom content based on the user's interests and reading history. This feature could be used to suggest new books or articles that align with their preferences.

Moreover, allow users to save their favorite artists, authors, and genres for easy access in future sessions. This would help users navigate the app's library more efficiently and effectively.

Finally, integrate a user-friendly messaging system where users can send messages to other users or admin for assistance. This feature could be utilized by customers who are not satisfied with the app's services or need help resolving an issue.

These additional features would enhance the app's functionality and make it more user-friendly, allowing users to easily access and interact with the content they desire.
